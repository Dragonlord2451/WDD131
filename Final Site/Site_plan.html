			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This website is designed for beginners who want to start their own YouTube channel but feel overwhelmed or unsure where to begin. 
                Many people have great ideas, skills, or passions they want to share, but they don’t know how to set up a channel, plan content, or grow an audience. My site provides simple, step-by-step guidance, helpful tools, and motivational tips to help new creators take the first steps toward launching their channel with confidence.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This feature will help boost the confidence and motivation of new YouTube creators by showing them an inspiring quote each time they visit the site. 
                Many beginners feel nervous or doubt their abilities when starting a channel. By displaying positive, encouraging messages, the site creates a welcoming atmosphere that helps reduce fear, 
                encourages action, and reminds visitors that everyone starts somewhere — they just need to take the first step.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>"The Motivational Quote of the Day feature will use JavaScript to display a random, encouraging quote each time the page loads, 
                helping to inspire new creators to take action and remind them that starting their YouTube journey is possible for everyone."
